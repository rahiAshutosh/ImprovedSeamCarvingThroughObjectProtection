AN ABSTRACT OF OUR PROJECT:-

This project focuses on Content aware image resizing through object protection.
The main purpose of Content-aware Image resizing is to resize an image to different sizes while retaining the integrity of objects in the image. 
We propose a methodology to effectively resize a given image to desirable dimensions without affecting the objects in the image.
Seam Carving proposed by Shai Avidan et al exists as one of the main modus-operandi for content aware image resizing.
A ‘seam’ is a connected path of the lowest energy pixels in the image (N4 neighbors). 
By the N4 neighbors of a pixel we mean the pixels lying on its immediate top, bottom, right & left. 
The method aims at removing the lowest energy pixels in the image as these blend effectively with the surroundings.
Removing these pixels shall not affect the image to a conspicuous extent. 
It is however seen that even this method of seam carving fails to protect the objects in the image to a great extent, so there remains a need to further improve seam carving.
Our method is aimed at improving the results of seam carving by employing the concept of object protection.
